        "K-fold cross validation using several values of K (3, 5, 7, and 10) was done in this Colab notebook for Ensemble models. The ensemble models used here include voting, bagging and stacking regressors. K-fold cross-validation is a model evaluation technique used in machine learning to assess how well a model generalizes to an independent dataset. It helps in avoiding overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of model performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "🔹 How It Works:The method involves splitting data into K equal-sized folds, iterating K times, using K-1 folds for training and the remaining 1 fold for testing. Performance metrics like accuracy, MSE, and F1-score are averaged over the K iterations. For example, with 100 samples, a 5-fold cross-validation would involve splitting data into 5 parts, running 5 iterations, and calculating and averaging the validation results.\n",
